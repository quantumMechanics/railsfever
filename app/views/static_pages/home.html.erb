	<h1>Agile development helps us put you first</h1>
	<p>We quickly prototype new features with Rails. Clients immediately visualize the results and provide valuable feedback. Not happy? No worries. Rails embraces change, and we have many built in tools that allow us to quickly modify features without pain. We guard software quality and are able to automatically confirm that we have not broken old features while adding new features, because we write code to test your code!</p>

<div class="banner clearfix ">
	<h1>Beat the competition by reducing your time to market</h1>
	<p>Ruby on Rails encourages Convention over Configuration. This means that developers write significantly fewer lines of code when compared to other frameworks. With Rails, it is easier to bring on new developers up to speed, since we all use the same 'Convention'. In addition, application maintenance is faster. Most importantly the time saved results in faster delivery time for our clients.</p>
