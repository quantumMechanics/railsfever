						<h2>We are a Philadelphia shop building web sites and apps using Ruby on Rails</h2>

						<h2>Beat the competition by reducing your time to market</h2>
						<p>Ruby on Rails encourages Convention over Configuration. This means that developers write significantly fewer lines of code when compared to other frameworks. With Rails, it is easier to bring on new developers up to speed, since we all use the same 'Convention'. In addition, application maintenance is faster. Most importantly the time saved results in faster delivery time for our clients.</p>

						<h2>Custom software elevates your application and your brand</h2>
						<p>In the past it was expensive to build custom applications. This resulted in shrink-wrapped solutions flooding the software market. Differentiate your company from other businesses by building a custom application. We will build scalable and maintianable software with the latest techniques in data collection, processing, visualization, test automation and security.</p>

						<h2>Agile development helps us put you first</h2>
						<p>We quickly prototype new features with Rails. Clients immediately visualize the results and provide valuable feedback. Not happy? No worries. Rails embraces change, and we have many built in tools that allow us to quickly modify features without pain. We guard software quality and are able to automatically confirm that we have not broken old features while adding new features, because we write code to test your code!</p>

				<h4 class="border-b">User-Centric</h4>
				<p class="bumpdown">Think intra-client-focused. Think viral. Think resource-constrained. Think user-centric. But don't think all three at the same time. The ability to redefine extensibly leads to the ability to incentivize iteravely.</p>
